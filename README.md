# Hi I'm Roberto Cassino ðŸ‘‹

**`Software Engineer Intern`**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently in my 4th year of studying Computer Science at Griffith College and working as a Software Engineer Intern at Keelvar.

Computers and technology have always fascinated me, and I'm truly passionate about building things from scratch. My academic journey and internship at Keelvar have allowed me to explore this passion in depth. Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in software engineering principles and a love for coding that propels me forward.

In my spare time, you'll find me working on various projects that allow me to experiment and broaden my skills. I aim to create solutions that can make an impact, no matter how big or small.

If you're interested in collaboration or just want to chat, feel free to reach out! I love meeting new people in the field, sharing ideas and learning from others.

Thanks for stopping by!
